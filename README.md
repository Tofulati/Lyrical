# Lyrical
*Find your music taste*

> ⚠️ **Currently in Development** ⚠️

## Description
On going project aimed at utilizing Spotify and a Chatbot (WPI) to find similar songs that follow the user's tastes. Once the project exits the development stage, it would be available to run utilizing local servers. 

The project may change throughout the development stage as I am still exploring the APIs

## Current Capabilities
- User can enter playlist url
- User can enter query song url
- User can type how many similar songs wanted
- Program prints completed dialogue (including reference and similar songs)

## Ideas
- [ ] User is able to ask the chatbot
- [ ] User is able to select a song (most listened or search)
    - [ ] Can chose from Genre and/or Language
    - [ ] Once selected, the user is prompted to highlight a line from their song
    - [ ] The line would be processed and search the APIs for similarities
    - [ ] Retrieve data and show User variety of songs
- [ ] User is able to listen to song or rerun program
    - [ ] Can create a playlist
        - Selectable?
        - Predetermined?
